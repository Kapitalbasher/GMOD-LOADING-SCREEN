# GMOD-LOADING-SCREEN

The procfile is just needed if you want to host the loading screen on e.g heroku.
its not very hard to customize you will probadly figure it out, but you can ask me for help if you dont.

example: http://gm-loading-screen.herokuapp.com/  
example-config: http://YOUR_HOST.com/?mapname=%m&&steamid=%s&&p=folder
to add images just put a folder, with images, in the "bilder" folder.
